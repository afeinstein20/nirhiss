This is a repository with NIRISS Stage 3 data reduction tools.


ADF_extracted_stellar_spectra
  - F277W filter from the median image, then gaussian filtered to smooth
    any noise
  - Removing cosmic rays and interpolating over
  - Using the 2D modeled background to get rid of 1/f noise
  - Subtracting the median from each column

ADF_extracted_stellar_spectra_method2
  - F277W filter from the median image, but only using the high outliers so
    it captures the 0th order effects and not any noise in the image
  - DQ masked and interpolated pixels
  - Using the SUBSTRIP256 model background provided on JDOX
  - Removing cosmic rays and interpolating over
  - Removing bad integrations (5 in total)
  - No additional background modeling
